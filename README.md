[jQuery Tools](http://flowplayer.org/tools/) - The Missing UI library for the Web
================================

Like everyone else, I should have used jQuery UI instead. But I didn't, and now this project needs to be used with jQuery 1.9.

I'm basically removing support for IE6. You should too.

This library also now strongly recommends using conditional IE comments for your document root and Modernizr.js. Otherwise, scientifically speak, your stuff might get messed up.
